            <h1 style="text-align:center">Senses</h1>
            <h2 class="chead">Vision</h2>
            <p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human
                vision.[60]:43 This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light
                that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim
                light.[70] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it
                to focus bright light without chromatic aberration.[71] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover
                most of the exposed surface of its eyes.[72] However, the domestic cat has rather poor color vision and
                only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to
                distinguish between red and green is limited.[73] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other
                than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to
                low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Hearing</h2>
            <p>The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[75] It can detect an extremely
                broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79,000 Hz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while
                humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.[76][77] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its
                large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It
                can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.[78][79]</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Smell</h2>
            <p>Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface
                of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans.[80] Cats and
                many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of
                flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to
                pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,[81] which they use to communicate through urine
                spraying and marking with scent glands.[82] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain
                nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per
                billion.[83] About 70â€“80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.[84] This response is also produced by
                other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the
                smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.[85]</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Taste</h2>
            <p>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human
                tongue).[86] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste
                buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.[87] Their taste
                buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.[88] Cats also have a
                distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 Â°C (100 Â°F)
                which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated
                (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or
                decomposing).</p>
