            <h4 class="chead">History:</h4>
            <p class="pborder">In the past, most notably in Egypt, people kept domestic cats because they hunted and ate
                mice and rats.
                Today,
                people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by
                people. These
                kinds of cats are called "feral cats".

                The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC.
                Ancient
                Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners "for all
                of
                eternity".

                Today, special food for cats is widely available in the developed countries. Proper feeding will help a
                cat live
                longer compared to hunting or being fed table scraps. Not correctly feeding a cat can lead to problems
                (see
                below for health concerns).

                Cats cannot taste sweet foods (with sugar) because of a mutation (change) in their ancestors which
                removed the
                ability to taste sweet things.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="chead">Food:</h4>
            <p class="pborder">Many house cats eat food which their owners give them. This food is manufactured, and
                designed to contain
                the right nutrients for cats. There are many different types of cat food. These come in many different
                flavors and costs are often very small.

                There is moist canned food and also dry cat food which comes in different sized cans or bags and
                formulas. There are kitten formulas, cat formulas, health formulas, formulas for reducing a cat's
                weight, and many others. These can even be organic (made from all natural ingredients), and have
                vegetables, salmon, tuna, meat, and milk essence. Yet, it's best if the food is at least 95% meat, as
                that's a cat's diet. Also, make sure the cat is not fed a daily diet of dog food. It could make the cat
                blind, as it has no taurine, which is a nutrient for the eyes.</p>
