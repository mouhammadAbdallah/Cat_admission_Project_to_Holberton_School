            <h1 style="text-align:center">Characteristics</h1>
            <h2 class="chead">Size</h2>
            <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[56] It averages about
                46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23â€“25 cm (9.1â€“9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long
                tails. Males are larger than females.[57] Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (8.8
                and 11.0 lb)</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Skeleton</h2>
            <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven
                lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five);
                and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae,
                fused into an internal coccyx).[58]:11 The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's
                spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[58]
                :16 Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which
                allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.[59]</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Skull</h2>
            <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized
                jaw.[60]:35 Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it
                overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them
                between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and
                death.[61] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the
                size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small
                vertebrae.[61] The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the
                mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in
                feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of
                mastication.[60]:37 Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less
                likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food
                particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional
                tooth loss and infection</p>

            <h2 class="chead">Ambulation</h2>
            <p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the
                visible leg.[63] Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the
                body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the
                track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure
                footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up walking to trotting, its gait
                changes to a "diagonal" gait: the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.[64]</p>
